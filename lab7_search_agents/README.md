# Morhunenko Mykola hw7

Self-documented code is better than documentation (I hope) so I tried to chose var's and functions names as good as possible.

#### Reflection
I consider to use the score, and make it preferable to kill the queen and not to move if it is dangerous and is possible to be killed. Also I changed the score for the queen and man. 
383 line, and I think if it will be the stack instead of the queue, then it will work in the very different way. If we use stack, it will be DFS, and it will be much more harder to find really the biggest sequence (BFS is better for such tasks)
